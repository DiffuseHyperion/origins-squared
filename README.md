Origins Minus is a collection of 10 origins designed to replace the vanilla origins.      
All origins descriptions fit within their cards as above.           
Low-impact origins are provided with no drawbacks, mid-impact origins have some possible downside.

The design is focused around encouraging players to lean into each origin due to its benefits, instead of forcing them into it with drawbacks.

This means there's less to fret about picking an origin - Just grab the origin that sounds the most fun!

It's also less to remember when loading a save, or when swapping origins with [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy).

If you'd prefer the datapack version for any reason, you can [download it from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/origins-minus/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link)

### Quilt 1.18.2

As of `v1.7.1` origins works out of the box with Quilt.           
On 1.18.2, you'll have to add a [quilt version of calio](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/quilt_1.18.2/mods/Calio-1.18.2-1.6.0.jar) as a workaround.

## Credits

Many origins are adapted from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos).
Most of these are simply cut down from their originals - check out the originals if you're interested!
