This mod is adapted from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos). Some of the best powers were sourced this way.

## Further Info

All modding projects are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt)! Our modpack about ease of play and expressiveness.

We're primarily modpack developers - not mod developers! If you want to port this mod, do it yourself!
