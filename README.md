Origins Minus is a collection of origins designed to replace the built-in set.

Included origins are short and sweet - with each description fitting inside their card.           
Low-impact origins have no drawbacks, while mid-impact origins may have minor constraints.

The design is intended lets players lean into their origin because it's fun! - not force them into it with limitations.

There's less to fret over while picking an origin, and less to remember when loading a save - or switching with [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy)!

### Versions

If you'd prefer the datapack version for any reason, you can [download it from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/origins-minus/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link)

As of `v1.7.1` origins works out of the box with Quilt.           
On 1.18.2, you'll have to add a [quilt version of calio](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/quilt_1.18.2/mods/Calio-1.18.2-1.6.0.jar) as a workaround.

### Credits

Many origins are adapted with permission from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos).
Most are simply cut down from their originals - check them out if you're interested!

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of play and self-expression.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
