Origins Minus is a collection of 10 origins designed to replace the vanilla origins.      
All origins descriptions fit within their cards as above.           
Low-impact origins are provided with no drawbacks, mid-impact origins have some possible downside.

The design is focused around encouraging players to lean into each origin due to its benefits, instead of forcing them into it with drawbacks. 

This means there's less to remember when loading a save, or to fret about when picking an origin - just grab what sounds the most fun! This is especially true when swapping between multiple origins using [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) 

This mod is a datapack packaged into a quilt mod, but you can still download the datapack version [from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/origins-minus/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link).

The mod version includes a partial compatibility patch for origins night vision and [True Darkness](https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness)


## Credits

Many origins are adapted from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos).
Most of these are simply cut down from their originals - check out the originals if you're interested!

## Further Info

All modding projects are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt)! Our modpack about ease of play and expressiveness.

We're primarily modpack developers - not mod developers! If you want to port this mod, do it yourself!
