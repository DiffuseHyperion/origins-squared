This mod is a datapack packaged into a quilt mod, but you can still download the datapack version [from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/origins-minus/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link).

This mod version includes a partial compatibility patch for origins night vision and [True Darkness](https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness)


## Credits

Many origins are adapted from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos).
Most of these are simply cut down from their originals - check out the originals if you're interested!

## Further Info

All modding projects are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt)! Our modpack about ease of play and expressiveness.

We're primarily modpack developers - not mod developers! If you want to port this mod, do it yourself!
